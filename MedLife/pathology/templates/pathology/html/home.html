                This procedure is conducted by our trained professionals who are known as phlebotomists, after which your sample reports can also be accessed online.
                Our professionals are skilled with their work and make the process very smooth.
                Our lab is now trying to provide the facility of home collection of samples to make it safe and easy for the people.
